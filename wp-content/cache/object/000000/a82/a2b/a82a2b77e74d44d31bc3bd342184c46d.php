Wanna start so quick. Don't you worry if you have never used google app engine or google cloud services, We will guide you through all the necessary steps. Else if you are already an expert and just want to know the implementation you can surely skip this one. Here I have listed very simple steps for bigquery basic setup.</p>
<p>1. Create a project on google cloud server.</p>

<p><a href="http://big-query-php.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-from-2015-06-06-003117.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-30 size-full" src="http://big-query-php.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-from-2015-06-06-003117-e1433531466308.png" alt="Screenshot from 2015-06-06 00:31:17" width="1366" height="351" /></a></p>
<p>2. Open google Big Query and Create new Dataset to work on.</p>
<p>3. Now you have access to bigquery and you can upload a new table by clicking on + icon on left of the dataset name, see the below screenshot for the reference. A pop-up window will open up and you can either choose to upload it from the google cloud storage or manually upload a csv file from the local machine. Here you will have to define the table schema. Try all this soon and we would try a bit more on the same window.</p>
<p><a href="http://webtutplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-from-2015-07-08-232217.png"><img src="http://webtutplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-from-2015-07-08-232217-1024x580.png" alt="Screenshot from 2015-07-08 23:22:17" width="1024" height="580" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-141 aligncenter" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. On the same window you may also be seeing option to write a query and execute it. If you have already tried uploading a table, go ahead with querying in the new table else use the public database available for querying. <strong>Don't get confused with sql databases and bigquery, there's a lot of difference you will soon know. You can only run select queries here. NO UPDATE. NO INSERT.Â </strong>These facilities are available through the api's they provide but again not by running queries. keep following me and you will get it all very soon.</p>
<p>5. Are you worried. I cant stand by it, Now I must tell you about using the api's. Lets first create a service account to use the api service from your application. keep in mind only admin can create a service account.

Yeah, you are at the right place. Click on create new client ID under Oauth2 and choose service account. Ta-Da. Congrats. Here the snapshot of what you will be expecting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6 .Â If you are wondering what is p12 key file and where to get it ?Â </p>
<p>Now you wont know but believe me you need it to authenticate the application to use google bigquery api. Better download it now.Â </p>
<p>And Yeah. You are all set.Â </p>
