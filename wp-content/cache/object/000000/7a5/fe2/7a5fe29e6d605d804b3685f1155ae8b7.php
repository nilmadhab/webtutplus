And there is nothing new in it. People have been doing this since the beginning of the life. Hunters sought patterns in animal migration, farmers sought patterns in the crop growth, politicians sought the voting patterns of voters and many more.<strong>Modern Data Analytics</strong> has just taken all this to a whole new level. Very efficient. Very accurate. Data scientists device methods and tools to extract patterns in the data, which is more valuable than you and me can ever imagine. Intelligently analyzed data is a very valuable resource. It can lead to new insights and, in commercial settings, to competitive advantages.

In this blog, we will see how data analytics is being used in several different fields.

<strong>1. Decision Involvement Judgement</strong>

Let us start with a very basic example. When you go to a bank for aÂ loan, they usually ask you to fill a questionnaire. That questionnaire will take your personal and professional details which might affectÂ your ability to repay the amount borrowed. All these act as an input parameter to anÂ ML program and then the program gives you a judgment. The result of this exercise gives a black and white picture to the bank, whether to lend you money or not. This is how data analytics helps you in the decision-making process. One quick fact, banks were among the first organizations to use data analysis on a wide commercial scale.

2. <strong>Screening Images</strong>

In early days of satellite imaging, data analysis was not very prominent in the field. Yet semi-automatic decision-making programs were there. That is primitive data analytics, I know. Those programs used to locate potential oil slicks by reading satellite images, again by using our very own machine learning tactics.

3.<strong>Load Forecasting</strong>

The need of the hour is to save electricity. Well said. No no, we canâ€™t save energy with data analytics,Â if thatâ€™s what you were thinking, but, we can predict its usage and can plan accordingly. A linear regression analysis has done it. Temperature, Humidity, Day, wind speed etc are being used as the features of the training sets and the regression is being used to forecast electricity usage. This regression analysis has also solved the problem of the daily weather <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">forecast.Now</span>, there is no need to appoint weather forecasters for the <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">prediction.The</span> results of the analysis were pretty much similar, but the process was faster.

4.<strong>Diagnosis</strong>

In big industries, machine failure has always been a nightmare. To ensure safety and smoothness in the industries, experts having 20 years of experience, inspect machines manually. Typical errors like a misalignment of a shaft, mechanical loosening or faulty bearings are all taken care of, manually! But nowadays, analyzing data of diagnostic tests by a program can reduce a lot of work. In fact, some industries are using such programs to assist experts and I believe that similar programs will eliminate manual checks completely, in the coming future.

5. <strong>Marketing and Sales</strong>

As I already said, data analysis can give you and your firm a competitive advantage over others. Let me give you an example for the same. <strong>Wallmart, topping the list of Fortune 500 companies</strong> (<a href="http://fortune.com/fortune500">http://fortune.com/fortune500</a>), and similar other shopping chain companies, read our shopping patterns. Then, the data speaks. For example, the data collected may reveal that we buy chips and cleaners together more on Thursday rather than the other day. There could be some logical reason for that, but the important thing is <strong>they know what we want and they know what we will buy and even when!</strong> So, they plan their storeâ€™s layout, discount offers, coupons and several other schemes accordingly. It also helps them to categorize customers for the future direction of their strategies. And this is how they make it big, real big!

So, we see that as the technology improves, data storage capacity increases.Â More data meaning more insights into the future. Predicting future, thatâ€™s something that we all ever wanted!!
